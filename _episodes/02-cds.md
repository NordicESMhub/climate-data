# Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)
This is a service operated by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Union. The C3S combines observations of the climate system with the latest science to develop authoritative, quality-assured information about the past, current and future states of the climate in Europe and worldwide.

# The Climate Data Store (CDS)
This is web portal providing a single point of access to a wide range of information about the past, present and future climate. This includes observations (i.e., in-situ measurements, remote sensing data, etc.), historical climate data records, estimates of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) derived from Earth observations, global and regional climate reanalyses of past observations, seasonal forecasts and climate projections.
